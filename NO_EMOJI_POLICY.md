- All UI components
- Email templates
- Dashboard displays
- Form labels
- Button text
- Notifications
- Documentation

### Examples:
- ❌ "🍔 Burger Roll Variance"
- ✅ "Burger Roll Variance"

- ❌ "⚠️ High variance detected!"
- ✅ "High variance detected!"

- ❌ "📊 Sales Summary"
- ✅ "Sales Summary"

**Remember: This is a professional restaurant management system, not a social media app.**
