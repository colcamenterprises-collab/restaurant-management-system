# NO FAKE DATA POLICY

## CRITICAL RULE: NEVER USE FAKE DATA

This policy is MANDATORY and applies to ALL situations:

### PROHIBITED ACTIONS:
- Creating fake sales figures
- Making up expense amounts  
- Inventing staff names or shift data
- Generating mock inventory numbers
- Fabricating any business data for testing
- Using placeholder values in email reports
- Creating synthetic data for demonstrations

### REQUIRED ACTIONS:
- Always query the database for authentic data
- Use real form submissions and records
- Pull actual sales figures from Loyverse API
- Reference genuine expense entries
- Use authentic staff names and shift information
- Verify data sources before using in reports

### CONSEQUENCES:
- Fake data corrupts business intelligence
- Creates false operational insights
- Misleads management decision-making
- Violates data integrity standards
- Breaks user trust in the system

### WHEN TESTING:
- Use actual database records (like real Form 197)
- Query live data from authorized sources
- If no real data exists, ask user to provide it
- Never create fake data "for testing purposes"

## REMEMBER: 
**AUTHENTIC DATA ONLY - NO EXCEPTIONS**

This policy was created after a violation where fake sales data was used instead of real Form 197 data from the database.
