To retrieve a list of receipts from Loyverse via their API, you'll need to use the get_by_query method within the Receipts endpoint, passing in specific query parameters to filter the results. 
Here's how you can do it:
1. Authentication:
You'll need to authenticate your API requests using an OAuth 2.0 token. You can obtain this token by following the Loyverse API documentation and connecting your Loyverse account to your application. 
2. Endpoint:
The relevant endpoint for retrieving receipts is located at /receipts. 
3. Request Parameters:
You can refine your search using various query parameters, such as:
receipt_numbers: Filter by specific receipt numbers. 
since_receipt_number and before_receipt_number: Retrieve receipts within a range of receipt numbers. 
store_id: Filter receipts by store. 
order: Sort the results (e.g., by date). 
source: Filter by the source of the receipt (e.g., POS, API). 
updated_at_min, updated_at_max, created_at_min, created_at_max: Filter by time ranges for updates or creations. 
limit: Limit the number of results returned. 
cursor: For pagination, use the cursor from the previous response to get the next page of results. 
4. Response:
The API will return a JSON object containing an array of receipt objects that match your criteria. 
Example (conceptual, using Python and the requests library):
Python

import requests
import json

def get_receipts(api_key, store_id=None, limit=10):
    url = "https://api.loyverse.com/v1/receipts"
    headers = {
        "Authorization": f"Bearer {api_key}",
        "Content-Type": "application/json"
    }
    params = {
        "limit": limit,
    }
    if store_id:
        params["store_id"] = store_id

    try:
        response = requests.get(url, headers=headers, params=params)
        response.raise_for_status() # Raise HTTPError for bad responses (4xx or 5xx)
        return response.json()
    except requests.exceptions.RequestException as e:
        print(f"Error: {e}")
        return None

# Replace with your actual API key and store ID
api_key = "YOUR_API_KEY"
store_id = "YOUR_STORE_ID"
receipts = get_receipts(api_key, store_id)

if receipts:
    print(json.dumps(receipts, indent=2))
Key points:
API Key: You'll need your API key, which you can obtain from the Loyverse Back Office under "Access Tokens". 
Store ID: If you want to filter by store, you'll need the corresponding store ID. 
Error Handling: It's crucial to implement proper error handling to catch potential network issues or API errors. 
Pagination: For large datasets, you'll need to handle pagination using the cursor parameter.
