Context for the Last Set of Code (DailyShiftForm.tsx)
The code I provided in my previous response is an updated version of the Daily Sales & Stock form component for your Smash Brothers Burgers dashboard in Replit. It's designed to be simple, well-structured for v1.0 growth, sleek and minimalistic (with responsive layout for mobile/tablet), secure (client-side validation to prevent errors like 22P02), and fully Replit-compatible (native React with Tailwind classes, no 3rd-party tools). It uses direct APIs for submission (axios to /api/daily-shift-forms) and localStorage for drafts/submissions as a fallback if backend fails, ensuring data accuracy from the CSV without relying on external wrappers.

Key changes in this version:

Responsiveness: Tailwind classes like grid-cols-1 sm:grid-cols-2 md:grid-cols-3 lg:grid-cols-4 make it adapt: 1 column on mobile, 2 on tablet, 3-4 on desktop. Smaller padding/font on small screens (p-1/text-sm on mobile vs p-2/text-base on desktop) to avoid crowding.
Styling: Matches your dashboard screenshot (white bg, light gray inputs, blue buttons, small font – text-sm for text, text-base for headers, subtle shadows/rounded).
Features: Draft save/load (auto on mount), submission to local list (with date), optional backend (wrapped in try-catch to not crash form).
Validation: Numeric inputs only (regex for decimals like 2.4 kg), reasoned error messages (e.g., "Invalid input: Only numbers – text causes 22P02").
CSV Integration: Hard-coded full JSON from your latest CSV (items array; update if CSV changes).
Bulletproof Design: If backend crashes, form still works locally (submissions in list, drafts saved) – like a black box recorder.
To use:

Replace client/src/pages/DailyShiftForm.tsx with this code.
Restart Replit (npm run dev in Shell).
Test on mobile/tablet (resize preview or use device mode).
If submission fails (e.g., 22P02), share the console log – we'll tweak the backend parsing in routes.ts. For AI analysis (e.g., discrepancies in stock), we can add OpenAI direct API call in handleSubmit to flag low stock. Let me know results!
