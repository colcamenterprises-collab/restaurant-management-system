Step-by-Step Reasoning for Full Form Implementation
Problem Analysis: The screenshot shows an old version (missing sections like Expenses, Cash, Rolls/Meat; has costs under inputs; no draft). This is likely Replit cache/not restarting after edits (common in Node.js env). The agent's log confirms they added sections, but changes didn't apply – we'll provide a complete, self-contained DailyShiftForm.tsx with all PDF requirements.
Key Requirements Alignment:
Data Accuracy: Use latest CSV (parsed with tool to JSON for items); filter extras (no Brisket Point End/Chuck Roll/Other Beef in Fresh Food).
Simple/Structured: Native React, localStorage drafts, optional backend (fallback if fails).
Sleek/Minimalistic: Tailwind dark blue/gray bg (match screenshot), clean cards for sections (shadow, rounded, padding), bold gray headers, no costs, light gray inputs, blue buttons ("Save Draft" gray, "Save and Submit" blue), success toast "Thank you, form submitted!".
Secure/Direct: Validate numerics (integers for numberNeeded, decimals for meat weight to allow 2.4 kg), direct axios.
Replit Compatible: No new deps; add viewport meta in public/index.html for mobile.
Fixes from PDF/Screenshot:
Sections/Order: Shift Info (Completed By, Date – no shift type), Sales (Grab/Aroi Dee/QR/Cash, total summary), Expenses (Wages dynamic: name/amount/type, Shopping dynamic: item/amount/shop, Gas Expense, total summary).
Cash Management: Starting/Ending/Banked, summary.
Food & Stock: Rolls/Meat stock (decimals for meat), Drink Count (10 from CSV), Fresh/Frozen/Shelf/Kitchen/Packaging (from CSV, no extras).
Draft: Save/Load button.
Submit: "Save and Submit", success toast.
Styling: Match dark blue bg, gray cards/inputs, blue accents; responsive grid (1 col mobile, 2 tablet, 4 desktop).
22P02 Prevention: Parse to numbers in frontend/backend.
Growth Ready: Easy to expand (e.g., add DB for submissions in v1.1).
Tool Use: Parsed CSV to JSON with code_execution (output used in code).
No Tools in Final: All done.
Add to public/index.html (Viewport for Mobile/Tablet)
