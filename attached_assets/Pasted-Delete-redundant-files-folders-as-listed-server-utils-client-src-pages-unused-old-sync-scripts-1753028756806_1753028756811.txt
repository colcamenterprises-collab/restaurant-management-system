Delete redundant files/folders as listed: server/utils/, client/src/pages/[unused], old sync scripts (validate-receipts.js, sync-receipts.js). Keep only: server/index.ts, routes.ts, db.ts, service.js; client/src/App.tsx, pages/[active], components/; shared/schema.ts. 
Backup project first (Download ZIP). Confirm deletion with user before proceeding."
Run in Replit terminal after approval.
Let’s streamline. Here’s the cleanup plan
Files/Folders to Remove:
server/utils/ (consolidate AI/email/Line logic into routes.ts or service.js).
client/src/pages/ (delete unused placeholders—keep Home, Operations, Finance, Analysis, Settings, etc. only).
Old scripts (e.g., validate-receipts.js, sync-receipts.js) if replaced by new analysis flow.
Duplicate node_modules/ (ensure single in root).
Clean Structure:
server/: index.ts, routes.ts, db.ts, service.js (AI/email/Line), node_modules/
client/: src/ (App.tsx, pages/, components/), public/, node_modules/
shared/: schema.ts
Root: .env, package.json, package-lock.json, .replit
Please add this to your memory for this project:
You are to execute only the exact commands I provide. Do not add, remove, or modify features unless I explicitly approve with 'Yes, implement [specific change]'. Log all actions in a file (e.g., agent.log) with timestamp and description. If unsure, ask for clarification.
Action: Add this to .replit or as a comment in index.ts for agent to read on startup.

Let’s test core features—share logs/errors if fail. Current time: 11:07 PM +07, July 20, 2025.
Form (Operations): Submit with data (e.g., burgerBunsStock: 50). Check DB: SELECT * FROM daily_stock_sales ORDER BY id DESC LIMIT 1;.
Loyverse Sync (Analysis): Run curl -X POST http://localhost:5000/api/loyverse/pull. Check receipts: SELECT * FROM loyverse_receipts LIMIT 5;.
AI Analysis: Upload CSV, trigger—view results.
Email: Manual trigger (add cron later)—check inbox.
Line Order: Set stock <80, test curl -X POST http://localhost:5000/api/auto-order.
Next Move
Approve cleanup? ("Yes, proceed with cleanup")
Specify fix (e.g., "Fix form calc for totalSales")?
