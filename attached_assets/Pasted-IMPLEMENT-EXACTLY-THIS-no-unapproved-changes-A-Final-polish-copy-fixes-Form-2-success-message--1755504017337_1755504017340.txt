IMPLEMENT EXACTLY THIS (no unapproved changes)
A) Final polish & copy fixes

Form 2 success message

Remove any alert("Saved Form 1") from client/src/pages/operations/DailySalesStock.tsx.

Replace with a neutral inline success note that disappears after 3–5s:

const [saved, setSaved] = useState<null | "ok" | "err">(null);

// after successful save:
setSaved("ok");
setTimeout(() => setSaved(null), 4000);


Render (top-right of the form body is fine):

{saved === "ok" && (
  <div className="rounded-md bg-emerald-50 text-emerald-700 px-3 py-2 text-sm">
    Stock & expenses saved
  </div>
)}
{saved === "err" && (
  <div className="rounded-md bg-rose-50 text-rose-700 px-3 py-2 text-sm">
    Save failed — please try again
  </div>
)}


Form names & labels (verify, do not rework UI):

Form 1 title: “Daily Sales”
Subtitle: “Step 1 of 2 — complete Sales, then you’ll be redirected to Stock.”

Form 2 title: “Daily Stock & Expenses”

Expenses section headers (Form 2):

“Shift Expenses” (shopping items)

“Staff Wages” (placeholder “Staff Name”)

Buttons:

Form 1: Next, Save draft

Form 2: Save (or Submit Day — your choice, but use that single label everywhere)

Delete buttons in expenses rows must be explicit Delete, not rounded “–”.

No modals/alerts anywhere in either form for success/failure.

API response contracts (unchanged)

POST /api/daily-sales → { ok: true, shiftId } (already correct)

Form 2 save → return { ok: true, shiftId } as well (if not already)

Sticky actions

Form 1 already uses bottom sticky actions.

Optional (nice-to-have): add the same bottom bar to Form 2 with Save on the right. If you implement, match the existing StickyActions component style.

B) QA you must run & paste back

Routing

/operations/daily-sales → Form 1 (200)

/daily-sales → redirects to /operations/daily-sales (200 on final)

/operations/daily-sales-stock → redirects to /operations/daily-sales

/operations/stock → Form 2 (200)

/operations/form2 → redirects to /operations/stock

End-to-end

Open /operations/daily-sales. Enter minimal data (date, completed by, starting cash; any sales).

Click Next.

Paste console line:

[Form1] will navigate: /operations/stock?shift=<uuid>

Confirm browser at /operations/stock?shift=<uuid>.

Paste console line from Form 2:

[Form2] shift: <uuid>

Screenshot of Form 2 showing Shift Expenses and Staff Wages sections rendered immediately.

Add one row in each expenses section and Save.

Paste the network response JSON from Form 2 save ({ ok: true, shiftId }).

Screenshot of the inline “Stock & expenses saved” note (no modal/alert).

API curl (Form 1)

curl -s -X POST http://localhost:5000/api/daily-sales \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"completedBy":"QA","cashStart":1000,"cashSales":10,"qrSales":0,"grabSales":0,"aroiDeeSales":0,"totalSales":10,"shiftDate":"2025-08-18T00:00:00.000Z","status":"submitted"}'
# Expect: {"ok":true,"shiftId":"..."}

C) Out of scope (log only, do not touch in this PR)

Global Expenses module for company-account purchases (with supplier/category lookups).

Menu Management features (import/compare, Chef review, descriptions).

Any typography/spacing/branding overhaul.

D) Merge check

Keep the Freeze Report in the PR description (route map, form map, API map, and CLI outputs).

Confirm no new alerts, and both forms follow the same { ok, shiftId } response pattern.
