You have my approval to delete every file in your list and then create the missing “golden” files per the lockdown spec.

1) Delete these now (all of them)

Legacy form files

DailyShiftForm.tsx.backup

DailyShiftForm.tsx

DailySalesAndStockForm.tsx

DailyStockForm.tsx

DailyStockSales.tsx

DailyStockSalesNew.tsx

DailyStockSalesQuick.tsx

DailyStockSalesSchema.tsx

DailyStockSalesSearch.tsx

DailyStockSalesSimple.tsx

SalesForm.tsx

Legacy dashboard files

DashboardModern.tsx (keep only the golden Overview page)

Legacy form-library files

DraftForms.tsx

DraftFormsLibrary.tsx

FormLibrary.tsx

FormView.tsx

FormsLibrary.tsx

PastForms.tsx

2) Before deleting – make a safety tag
git add -A
git commit -m "Pre-lock cleanup snapshot"
git tag -a pre-lock-snapshot -m "Snapshot before legacy purge"
git push --follow-tags

3) Create the missing golden files

Create these exact paths and wire them to the current, working versions you see in the app today:

client/src/components/PageShell.tsx            # shared layout, paddings, headings, shadows
client/src/pages/dashboard/Overview.tsx        # Home page (final)
client/src/pages/operations/DailySalesLibrary.tsx
client/src/pages/operations/DailySalesStock.tsx  # 2-step Daily Sales & Stock (the locked version)


For each of the above files: add the LOCKED banner at the very top:

/**
 * ⚠️ LOCKED FILE — Do not replace or refactor without Cam’s written approval.
 * This is the FINAL implementation used in production. All alternatives were removed on purpose.
 */


Use the versions that match what Cam reviewed yesterday (no schema or layout changes, only the agreed styling).

4) Route registry (single source)

Replace client/src/App.tsx with the Route Registry we provided in the lockdown kit so only these routes are mounted:

/ → Overview

/daily-sales → DailySalesStock

/daily-sales-library → DailySalesLibrary

/upload-statements → UploadStatements

/receipts → Receipts

/shift-summary → ShiftSummary

/profit-and-loss → ProfitAndLoss

/ingredients → Ingredients

/cost-calculator → CostCalculator

/managers-nightly-checklist → NightlyChecklist

5) Guard the build

Add the prebuild guard (as sent earlier):

scripts/guard-build.js

package.json → "prebuild": "node ./scripts/guard-build.js"

Then run:

node scripts/guard-build.js
npm run build


Paste the guard output in your reply.

6) Final commit & tag
git add -A
git commit -m "LOCKDOWN: delete legacy files, add golden pages, add build guards"
git tag -a locked-forms-v1 -m "Golden snapshot of locked forms"
git push --follow-tags

7) Report back with:

The deletion list actually removed (paths).

Confirmation the four golden files were created and contain the LOCKED banner.

guard-build output (should say “✅ Layout and route guard passed.”).

Screenshot of the app running with the Daily Sales & Stock form exactly as yesterday’s locked version and the Daily Sales Library visible.

Diff or commit hash for locked-forms-v1.

Proceed.
