Loyverse API (1.0)
Using the REST API
The Loyverse API follows the general patterns of REST. You can use the resources of a Loyverse account (items, receipts, etc.) by making HTTPS requests to URLs that represent those resources. You can find description of all the endpoints here.

To test and explore Loyverse API you can use Postman. Postman is a powerful HTTP client for testing RESTful APIs by displaying requests and responses in manageable formats.

These are steps you need to take to start testing Loyverse API via Postman:

Download and install Postman. You can get it here: https://www.getpostman.com

Get Loyverse API Postman Collection and import it into Postman.

Define variables used in postman collection. For example, in Loyverse production environment for Loyverse API v1.0 you should define baseUrl variable as https://api.loyverse.com/v1.0. It is useful to configure variables in postman environments so you will not have to redefine the values for each request manually. Learn more about Postman environments

Configure the Postman Authorization header. Each request to Loyverse API should contain a token in request header. You can read more about ways to get the token in the Authorization section of the documentation.

Once you complete these steps you are ready to make calls to Loyverse API via Postman.

Versioning
The Loyverse API uses versioning. This documentation is for version 1.0 of the API. Version must be specified in the base URL, for example: https://api.loyverse.com/v1.0

Authorization
An application credential is any piece of information that identifies, authenticates, or authorizes an application in some way.

Loyverse API provide two authorization methods:

Personal access tokens
OAuth 2.0
Personal access tokens
Personal access tokens are a simple way to make calls to the API. This authorization method suites best e.g. for periodically running scripts on data of your own account.

You can get your personal access token on the corresponding page in the back office of your account. For every call to the API you must include your access token in the Authorization header:

{
  Authorization: Bearer fMYgxHEYtcyT8cvtvgi1Za5DRs4vArSyvydlnd9f
}
Be aware that personal access token gives unlimited access to the targeted account.

OAuth 2.0
The main steps of OAuth flow are:

Creating your app
Requesting a temporary authorization code
Requesting an access token
Making API requests
Refreshing the access token as needed
Creating an application
To create an app go to the developer dashboard and specify all required data for your app. After successfully creating your app you will be given a set of 2 unique keys client_id and client_secret which are used to identify your app and are required to complete the authorization process.

OAuth Authentication Flow
The merchant (resource owner) needs to authorize your app to access their data. Guide them to the authorization URL so that they can authorize your app. Authorization URL must be in format:

https://api.loyverse.com/oauth/authorize?client_id={client_id}&scope={scope}&response_type=code&redirect_uri={redirect_uri}&state={state}
This URL must contain query parameters:

client_id: the app id provided when creating your app.
response_type: specify ‘code’ that means your app is requesting an authorization code grant.
redirect_uri: should be equal to one of the redirect URL list provided when creating your app.
scope: the list of permissions to the retailer's account that you app needs (the complete list of permissions see below). The scope values must be separated with the space character, %20.
state: a random value provided by your app that is unique for each authorization request. It is used to link requests and callbacks to prevent cross-site request forgery attacks. During the OAuth callback, your app must check that this value matches the one you provided during authorization.
Permissions list:

Permission	Description
CUSTOMERS_READ	Read customer information
CUSTOMERS_WRITE	Edit customer information
EMPLOYEES_READ	Read employee information
ITEMS_READ	Read items, categories, discounts and modifiers
INVENTORY_READ	Read inventory
INVENTORY_WRITE	Edit inventory
ITEMS_WRITE	Edit items, discounts, categories and modifiers
MERCHANT_READ	Read merchant information
PAYMENT_TYPES_READ	Read payment types
POS_DEVICES_READ	Read POS devices information
POS_DEVICES_WRITE	Update POS devices information
RECEIPTS_READ	Read receipts
RECEIPTS_WRITE	Create receipts
SHIFTS_READ	Read shifts
STORES_READ	Read store information
SUPPLIERS_READ	Read supplier information
SUPPLIERS_WRITE	Edit supplier information
TAXES_READ	Read taxes
TAXES_WRITE	Edit taxes
Once directed to this link, the merchant will be asked to log in to their Loyverse account (if he is not already logged in). He will then be asked to allow or deny the authentication request. After allowing access, an authorization code will be sent back to your app to the specified redirect URI.

Once you have the authorization code, your app can now request an access token by sending a request to the following Access Token URL:

https://api.loyverse.com/oauth/token
The payload of your request must be with Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded and include:

client_id
client_secret
redirect_uri
code
grant_type (specify ‘authorization_code’)
In case of successful request you will get a response with an access token. Response example:

{
  "access_token": "39557133-8881-4ce7-99b5-2ab4d15c2092",
  "token_type": "Bearer",
  "expires_in": 43200,
  "refresh_token": "J3F62YPIQdfJjJia1xJuaHp7NoQYtm9y0WadNBTh",
  "scope": "ITEMS_READ"
}
Once you receive an access token you can use it to interact with the Loyverse API on behalf of the merchant by providing the access token in an Authorization header.

Refreshing access token
When the access token expires you can obtain a new one by making POST request to https://api.loyverse.com/oauth/token with the following parameters:

client_id
client_secret
refresh_token
grant_type (specify "refresh_token")
OpenID Connect
OpenID Connect is a simple identity layer on top of the OAuth 2.0 protocol. It allows your app to authorize the user and obtain basic user profile information.

ID token is a JSON Web Token (JWT) that contains identity information about the user that is digitally signed by Loyverse. To get ID token you need to specify OPENID scope in the authorization request along with other scopes that are necessary for your app.

Response example:

{
  "access_token": "39557133-8881-4ce7-99b5-2ab4d15c2092",
  "id_token": "eyJ0eXAiOiJKV1QiLCJhbGciOiJSUzI1NiJ9.eyJzdWIiOiI5ZTY4MjE0Ny1kZDdlLTExZWEtODNiMi05MDJiMzRhNWEwMzkiLCJhdWQiOiI2Nzc5ZWYyMGU3NTgxN2I3OTYwMiIsImNvdW50cnkiOiJqcCIsImlzcyI6Imh0dHBzOi8vYXBpLmxveXZlcnNlLmNvbSIsIm5hbWUiOiJQT1MzIiwiY3JlYXRlZF9hdCI6IjIwMTgtMDYtMDRUMTU6NDQ6MjAuMDIwKzAzOjAwIiwiZXhwIjoxNjAxNDI0MDAwLCJpYXQiOjE1OTg4Njk3MDgsImVtYWlsIjoicG9zQG1haWxpbmF0b3IuY29tIn0.n2wQZtRRU0k2bGxSaz9BY6blf8dAXDAG47UBbAiW9vH8YVnZ1CBcvxkzARAUDjTGuZbGLLUFvzHLT8X5DPulXUt8LhZS2YOpnJccVWrH8RiatwAErwmGGkxJisPwJrFVgQ0qX0O2Wo3NiA_UfY9g3SSveexfOE6g2VWTct8eMdzB0qTyBrtIPtBSVXApdSxF1d5Abl8e2xu2R5LDTdQhb4YxzLejU-sU9ppdYedJBqorhzJBfs6Mi7YyzsCGQ5SrY1ZA7pQNHuO9bUijyj3pHMshlcpvZJzxOfYbEczyUKMsQPdlqdgHGlyaoYJhQuVKPVxVz06dpBBpsdwMfI6Ofw"
  "token_type": "Bearer",

  "refresh_token": "J3F62YPIQdfJjJia1xJuaHp7NoQYtm9y0WadNBTh",
  "scope": "OPENID ITEMS_READ ITEMS_WRITE RECEIPTS_READ"
}
An ID token consists of three encoded parts separated by dots:

Header
Payload
Signature
Header is Base64Url encoded JSON with the following structure:

{
  typ: "JWT",
  alg: "RS256"
}
typ: the type of the token
alg: the hashing algorithm being used, such as HMAC SHA256 or RSA
The second part of ID token is a payload that has metadata about the user. Loyverse provides following fields (claims):

Claim	Description
aud	The audience that this ID token is intended for. It must be the OAuth 2.0 client ID of a developer app.
exp	The time when ID token expires, represented in Unix time (integer seconds).
iat	The time the ID token was issued. Represented in Unix time (integer seconds).
iss	The issuer identifier for the issuer of the response. This is always set to https://api.loyverse.com
sub	An identifier for the user, unique among all Loyverse accounts and never reused. You can use sub within your application as the unique-identifier key for the user.
country	The country code associated with the merchant account (ISO 3166-1-alpha-2 format)
name	The name of business
email	The account email address
created_at	The date and time when the merchant account was created
The payload example:

{
  "sub": "b4d08058-dc81-11ea-90b4-1269e7c5a22d",
  "aud": "rmCfGKJJ22UdUGndankJ",
  "iss": "https://api.loyverse.com",
  "iat": 1353601026,
  "exp": 1353604926,
  "country": "jp",
  "name": "Best Store",
  "created_at": "2020-06-04T15:44:20.020+03:00",
  "email": "jsmith@example.com",
}
The same info you can get by calling https://api.loyverse.com/userinfo endpoint. The third part of JWT is signature which is used to verify that the sender of the JWT is Loyverse and used to ensure that the message wasn’t changed along the way. To verify signature you should use keys that you can get by calling api.loyverse.com/.well-known/jwks.json endpoint. Response example:

{
  "keys":
  [
    {
      "kty":"RSA",
      "n": "0vx7agoebGcQSuuPiLJXZptN9nndrQmbXEps2aiAFbWhM78LhWx

      "e":"AQAB",
      "alg":"RS256",
      "kid":"2011-04-29"
    }
  ]
}
Discovery document
The OpenID Connect protocol requires the use of multiple endpoints for authenticating users, and for requesting resources including tokens, user information, and public keys. To simplify implementations and increase flexibility, OpenID Connect allows the use of a "Discovery document," a JSON document found at a well-known location containing key-value pairs which provide details about the OpenID Connect provider's configuration, including the URIs of the authorization, token, revocation, userinfo, and public-keys endpoints. The Discovery document for Loyverse OpenID Connect service may be found here:

https://api.loyverse.com/.well-known/openid-configuration
Response example:

{
  "issuer": "https://api.loyverse.com",
  "authorization_endpoint": "https://api.loyverse.com/oauth/authorize",
  "token_endpoint": "https://api.loyverse.com/oauth/token",
  "userinfo_endpoint": "https://api.loyverse.com/userinfo",

  ],
  "response_types_supported": [
    "code"
  ]
}
Pagination
Some API endpoints paginate their responses to make the result set easier to handle. For example, if you request a list of items that is potentially too large to handle efficiently, the endpoint will return the first batch of results along with a marker of some kind to access the next batch of results. You may be able to avoid dealing with pagination by narrowing your initial request.

Paginated results include a cursor field as part of the response body. To fetch the next set of results, send a followup request to the same endpoint and provide the cursor value returned in the previous response as a query parameter. When the endpoint sends the final set of results, the response body will not include a cursor field.

It is possible to change the number of objects returned in the response. It can be done by passing the limit parameter. Default value is 50 and maximum is 250.

API rate limits
The Loyverse API platform applies rate limits to the API requests that it receives. Every request is subject to throttling under our general limits. There are additional resource-based rate limits. Your app should be prepared to implement retry behavior if it is throttled. The current limit is 300 requests per 300 sec per account. All requests that are made after rate limits have been exceeded are throttled and an HTTP 429 Too Many Requests error is returned.

Date and time format
All dates and times in the API are in UTC. In requests you should specify dates and times in UTC. When processing responses you should convert dates and times to your local time.

Soft deletion
Loyverse uses soft-deletion for most of its records. In the API, a soft-deleted object will have a special status. These records will not be returned by default, but can be accessed using "show_deleted" = "true" filter and have deleted_at parameter. Notice that some resources (like customers) don't use soft deletion due to personal data restrictions.

Handling errors
The API will return an Error List for a failed request, which will contain one or more Error objects.

{
  errors: [
    {
      code: "NOT_FOUND",
      details: "The resource was not found",
      field: "category_id"
    }
  ]
}
The Loyverse API uses the following error codes:

Error code	Description
500 INTERNAL_SERVER_ERROR	Generic internal server error. Try again later.
400 BAD_REQUEST	General client error. The request was not understood by the server, generally due to bad syntax.
400 INCORRECT_VALUE_TYPE	The JSON value type for the field is incorrect. For example, a string instead of an integer.
400 MISSING_REQUIRED_PARAMETER	A required path, query, or body parameter is missing.
400 INVALID_VALUE	A parameter's value is incorrect.
400 INVALID_RANGE	Specified time range is incorrect. For example, the end time is before the start time.
400 INVALID_CURSOR	The pagination cursor is incorrect.
400 CONFLICTING_PARAMETERS	1 or more of the request parameters conflict with each other.
401 UNAUTHORIZED	An authentication error. Request had a missing, malformed, or invalid authorization data
402 PAYMENT_REQUIRED	The subscription of account has lapsed
403 FORBIDDEN	The resource requested is not available with your permissions
404 NOT_FOUND	The resource was not found
415 UNSUPPORTED_MEDIA_TYPE	The server doesn't accept the submitted content-type.
429 RATE_LIMITED	The request was not accepted because the application has exceeded the rate limit.
Webhooks overview
Webhooks are the best way to get real-time notifications about different events in Loyverse system. One way to be in sync with Loyverse updates is to periodically pull the particular endpoint, but webhooks give you more effective way to accomplish this task.

Supported webhook events:

Event	Description
inventory_levels.update	Webhook is fired when a item’s inventory is updated.
items.update	Webhook is fired when an item is created, updated or deleted.
customers.update	Webhook is fired when a customer is created, updated or deleted.
receipts.update	Webhook is fired when a receipt is created or updated.
shifts.create	Webhook is fired when a closed shift is created.
When an event occurs, Loyverse collects data on the event, creates a notification, and sends it as a POST request to the notification URL registered while configuring webhook.

Adding webhook
There are two ways to configure webhooks:

Using /webhook endpoint
Using web interface which can be accessed on https://r.loyverse.com/dashboard/#/webhooks
You can subscribe to a single event in one webhook. The combination of event type and url must be unique. The specified URL must be formatted correctly, use the HTTPS, and be reachable.

Webhook payload
Once you create a webhook, Loyverse will send a HTTP POST request to the URL defined by the webhook every time when event occurs. The POST request contain JSON data with details of the object that caused the hooked event and HTTP headers that provide context.

Payload example for inventory_levels.update event type:

{
  "merchant_id": "5fk4f446-01d2-8787-4fd5-7b7b1995df85",
  "type": "inventory_levels.update",
  "created_at": "2020-06-07T17:23:48.562Z",
  "inventory_levels": [
    {
      "variant_id": "5fk4f446-01d2-8787-4fd5-7b7b1995df85",
      "store_id": "5fk4f446-01d2-8787-4fd5-7b7b1995df85",
      "in_stock": 0,
      "updated_at": "2019-08-24T14:15:22Z"
    }
  ]
}
Payload example for orders.update event type:

{
  "merchant_id": "5fk4f446-01d2-8787-4fd5-7b7b1995df85",
  "type": "orders.update",
  "created_at": "2020-06-07T17:23:48.562Z",
  "orders": [
    {
      "order_id": "5fk4f446-01d2-8787-4fd5-7b7b1995df85",
      "store_id": "5fk4f446-01d2-8787-4fd5-7b7b1995df85",
      "updated_at": "2019-08-24T14:15:22Z",
      "status": "COMPLETED"
    }
  ]
}
You will find additional HTTP headers for a request:

HTTP header	Description
X-Loyverse-Signature	A signature used to validate the notification authenticity (see Validate notifications section for more information)
X-Loyverse-API-version	Used to confirm what version of the Loyverse API used to serialize the webhook payload (for example "v1.0")
If there is batch update of objects in the system (for example, caused by items import), Loyverse will send several request with maximum 100 objects in the array.

Testing webhook
If you create a webhook via web interface, you can quickly test your configuration by sending test notification. Loyverse will send test POST request with the dummy data the specified URL. When testing webhooks, you can run your server or use different services such as Beeceptor.

Validate notifications
Your webhook endpoints are public and anyone can send requests to it. This is the reason why you must validate webhook notifications to confirm that they came from Loyverse. Webhooks requests sent to OAuth-authorised applications are signed with base64-encoded X-Loyvere-Signature header, which value is generated using the app's secret along with the data sent in the request. Compute the HMAC digest according to the following algorithm and compare it to the value in the X-Loyverse-Signature header. If they match, then the webhook was sent from Loyverse.

Request timeout and retries
When receiving webhook request on your end you must send a 2xx response. Any response outside of the 2xx range, will be considered by Loyverse as a delivery failure. Loyverse does not follow redirects for webhook notifications and considers them to be an error response. In the case of delivery failure Loyverse will retry sending the request 200 times during 48 hours. If there is no 2XX response within this time range, then the webhook status will be changed to "Disabled". Loyverse will send a warning message to the developer email address.

Create a refund receipt
When using the refund API you should take into account these notes:

At the moment refund API allows creating a refund only for sales receipts which are paid by a single payment. For any attempt to make a refund for a sales receipt that has more than one payment Loyverse API will respond with an error.
Refund API doesn't support a refund of receipts paid by integrated payments using Loyverse POS app (e.g. iZettle, Sumup, etc.). For this purpose please use Loyverse POS app.
If a refund is created successfully, it will cause a restock of items specified in a refund receipt.
